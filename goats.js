        <li>
          Chase was using the &#x1F410; emoji long before this page ever
          existed.

        <li>
          Chase can drink everyone under the table and still crank out code
          (that he doesn't remember writing)

          Chase regularly climbs up sheer cliff faces and eats vegetation.

        <li>
          The origin of his name means &quot;goat&quot; in many languages and
          cultures.
        </li>

      Chase is gone but never forgotten and we still stumble on pull requests he
      created and we never looked at from time to time. Bye forever.
